  <h1>Brulee</h1>
  <p>A <b>cute</b> and hopefully <b>simple</b> C/CPP IDE.</p>
</div>

# Why
Once every 6-8 months, I get the urge to make an IDE or editor.. it's just that time of the year. Even tho the foundation (the renderer) is **a bit** hard to use, I do hope this one will last longer than the others (I mean.. this one even got a logo, would be a shame to never finish it..). It's more of a personal project, but I will definitely look over pull requests and merge them if they align with my vision (don't ask me what that is, I have no idea either).

# How 
Brulee is built using Tauri (a native browser-based electron alternative) that used rust for the backend. I chose to not use any frameworks and instead to build my own (crappy) one. I guess the main incentive is that I don't know how to use any frameworks, but also, I kinda want to try and make one, a weird one, with a tree-like structure and update loops (a very game dev approach to a framework, hence I called it renderer).

# When
I have no idea when or even if Brulee will be even close to usable. At the moment I'm still thinking over the basic stuff and making breaking changes every commit, so please do be patient.
